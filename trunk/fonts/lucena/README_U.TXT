                         TrueType Font: CHESS LUCENA

  The figures of this font were adapted from the images of the diagrams from
the book 'El Incunable de Lucena. Primer arte de ajedrez moderno.'  by J. P.
de Arriaga, this is a book of analysis which accompanies  the  facsimile  of
the incunable  of  Lucena.  It  is  an  edition  to  commemorate  the  500th 
anniversary of its original publication. Juan Carlos Sanz Menendez sent them
to me, and I thank him for his kindness and his suggestions.

  The figures were created on Corel Draw and later reexported  to  TTF  with
the Fontographer 4.0. I made the font in the school "Colegio La Salle de San
Cristobal", located in the pleasant mountains of  the  Mayan World,  in  the
Southeast of Mexico.  The font is freeware, I hope it proves useful  to  all
the friends of chess. If you want to help us expand our font collection, you
can send us some other font for creating chess diagrams or  some  images  of
fonts that appear in old chess books.  Your comments  and  suggestions  will
always be welcome, send them to either of the addresses that appear below.

  The font is installed in Windows, as in any other TTF  font.  It  will  be
helpful to you for making chess diagrams standard, chess diagrams in  color, 
and figurine notation in the word processors which are  run  under  Windows.
The file CHESLUCE.DOC which accompanies this file is made on  Word 6.0,  and
contains two samples of the creation of diagrams in a word proccesor  and  a
keymap of this font.  You will not see these  characters  until  the  'Chess
Lucena' font is installed in your computer.  The distribution of the figures
on the keyboard is the same as in the CHESS MARROQUIN font, as follows:

MASKS: (For COLOR diagrams)
                                     CHARACTER      ASCII
       Dark square                       <           060  (zero longitude)
       Dark square                       >           061  (normal longitude)
       Pawn's mask                       [           091  (zero longitude)
       Knight's mask                     \           092  (zero longitude)
       Bishop's mask                     ]           093  (zero longitude)
       Rook's mask                       ^           094  (zero longitude)
       Queen's mask                      _           095  (zero longitude)
       King's mask                       `           096  (zero longitude)


* The EXTRA keys contain round corners.  The keys  (x),  (X),  (.), and  (:)
  contain auxiliary symbols to indicate individual movements of the  pieces.

NOTE: Also you find borders with the coordinates of chessboard.  For  simple
      borders, type the ASCII codes  from  0192  to  0207,  and  for  double
      borders from 0224 to 0239.  Don't forget to type [Alt]  and  the  ZERO
      which goes with each code to generate these characters.

      For the squares of zero longitude (the masks), the next key  needs  to
      be the character for the corresponding  piece  (on a light backround).
      COLOR DIAGRAMS:   1) to chose the color,  2) to write the mask,  3) to 
      chose other color, and 4) to write the character.

      The figurine notation pieces are in the ASCII codes from 0162 to 0167.

      I recommend you to print the .DOC file and see the complete keymap.
