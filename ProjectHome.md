Chess Imager makes it easy to add a chessboard diagram to your blog or other web page. All you have to do is insert an image link with a special URL that contains the chess position information. The URL runs a script that generates the image for you dynamically.

For example, the image below is generated dynamically using the URL http://www.eddins.net/steve/chess/ChessImager/ChessImager.php?fen=5N1k/6p1/7p/4P3/pp2Q3/4q3/1P4PP/2b4K/

If you are familiar with the chess position notation (called Forsyth Edwards Notation, or FEN), then you should have enough information to make your own diagrams. See the documentation for a brief explanation of FEN.
